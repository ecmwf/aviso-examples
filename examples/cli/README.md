# CLI Triggers for Aviso

This section contains three distinct types of triggers that can be utilized via the command-line interface (CLI) with the **aviso** software. Each trigger type is stored in its own directory and offers unique functionalities.

## Directory Structure

This folder comprises three subdirectories, each representing a different trigger type:

- `echo`
- `log`
- `command`

### Echo Trigger

Located in the `echo` directory, the Echo trigger is the simplest form of notification trigger in **aviso**. It outputs the notification directly to the console. This trigger is ideal for quick and straightforward demonstrations of how **aviso** notifications appear.

### Log Trigger

The `log` directory contains the Log trigger. This trigger is designed to log notification events to a specified log file. It's useful for maintaining a record of all notifications that **aviso** generates over time.

### Command Trigger

Finally, the `command` directory houses the Command trigger. This trigger allows users to define a shell command that interacts with the notification. It offers flexibility and can be used to execute a wide range of tasks in response to a notification.

## Getting Started

To begin using these CLI triggers with **aviso**, navigate to the respective directory of the trigger you wish to use and follow the usage instructions provided in the `README.md` file.
